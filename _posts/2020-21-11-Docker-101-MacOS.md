# Docker 101

## Synopsis

This note tries to explain basic operation of docker in `Mac OS Big SUR`. The most of commands are taken from this [site](https://www.robinwieruch.de/docker-macos).

## Why

I have a computer with only 250GB of space, so I have to be creative to not run out of space. No, this is excuse. 

The true is after watching **LiveOverflow** video about dockers, I visited his pwn_docker_example repository. When I tried to install the ctf docker an error appeared. I went to git and saw the following [message](https://github.com/LiveOverflow/pwn_docker_example/issues/2#issuecomment-600900780). So I decided to make my own docker for binary exploitation. In the middle of the process I learned a lot about how it works.

PS: I really have only 250GB of space.

## The Final Result

After following this instructions you can be a happy user with a docker like in the image below to learn binary exploitation in [https://pwn.college](https://pwn.college) and [LiveOverflow YT](https://youtu.be/iyAyN3GFM7A) or any other site.

# Install Docker in Mac OS Big Sur

## Suffer path

Necessary tools:

1. [brew](https://brew.sh)
2. Virtualbox # Installed from brew
3. Patience

First, You need install `docker` from `brew` with the following command:

```
brew update
brew install docker
```

Native docker uses a *linux environment* , so you must create one. For this install virtualbox and docker-machine:

```
brew install docker-machine
brew cask install virtualbox
```

> If the last install fails, check your MacOS' System Preference and verify if System software from developer "Oracle America, inc" was blocked from loading shows up. If you see it, hit the "Allow"-button and install it again.
> Copied from https://www.robinwieruch.de/docker-macos

> Another fix if above step not work is reset virtual box configuration in `mac os big sur` with `sudo "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/LaunchDaemons/VirtualBoxStartup.sh" restart`.

Now run `brew install docker-compose`. This is step is optional.Only install, if you need create a docker image from scratch.

After this suffering all necessary tools to docker run in `mac os big sur` is installed.

## Setup Environment

With `docker-machine`, create an `engine` for `docker` in `mac os big sur`. Just type `docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default` in terminal.

> This is step is most critical. If there some trouble, try to reinstall and reset `virtualbox` configuration.

Next step is run `docker-machine ls`. If everything is right, you can start the `engine` running `docker-machine start` . Cross the fingers 🤞and type:

```
docker-machine ls
NAME      ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER      ERRORS
default   *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v19.03.12
```

Finally run `docker-machine env default`:

```
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/mydspr/.docker/machine/machines/default"
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="default"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(docker-machine env default) <-- PAY ATENTION HERE 
```

Lastly command:

```
eval $(docker-machine env default)
```

### Check if works

Run `docker run hello-world`. If you see output that tells you that `docker` is installed correct and ready to use, congratulations  👏. Otherwise, [google](www.google.com) is your best friend.

#
# setup some customizations in vim,tmux and zshrc
WORKDIR /root
COPY dotfiles.7z /root
RUN 7z x /root/dotfiles.7z
```

The `dotfiles.7z` is some customizations in `zsh`, `vim`  and `tmux`. Now run the following commands to build docker:

```
docker build -t pwndumb:ubuntu20.10 .
```

So far so good. If the command above running ok, now we must run the container. For this type in terminal:

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/pwd --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -d --name pwndumb -i pwndumb:ubuntu20.10
```
- --rm: remove the container after exit
- -v $PWD:/pwd: volume to share data between host and docker. The actual directory will be available in the /pwd directory inside docker image.
-  -cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined: security related
- -d: detache mode
- --name pwndumb: set container name
- -i pwndumb:ubuntu20.10:  run interactively

Finally for exec or "attach" the docker type:

```bash
docker exec -it pwndumb /bin/zsh
```


PS: You must type inside vim in normal mode: `coc-python`. 
The time of creation is about `1,01s user 1,10s system 0% cpu 30:02,24 total` because the download of libc-database. 

Its better use the site version at [https://libc.rip](https://libc.rip) and comment the line of libc-database in `Dockerfile`.

## containers

The docker system prune command removes all stopped containers, dangling images, and unused networks:

```bash
docker system prune
docker system prune -a
docker system prune --volumes
```

To remove one or more Docker containers, use the docker container rm command, followed by the IDs of the containers you want to remove.
You can get a list of all containers by invoking the docker container ls command with the -a option:

```bash
docker container ls -a
```

Once you know the CONTAINER ID of the containers you want to delete, pass it to the docker container rm command. For example, to remove the first two containers listed in the output above, you would run:

```bash
docker container rm cc3f2ff51cab cd20b396a061
```

To remove all stopped containers, invoke the docker container prune command:

```bash
docker container prune
```

If you want to get a list of all non-running (stopped) containers that will be removed with docker container prune, use the following command:

```bash
docker container ls -a --filter status=exited --filter status=created
```

The docker container prune command allows you to remove containers based on a certain condition using the --filter option.

```bash
docker container prune --filter "until=12h"
```

To stop all running containers, enter the docker container stop command followed by the containers IDs:

```bash
docker container stop $(docker container ls -aq)
```

The command docker container ls -aq generates a list of all containers. New system 
Once all containers are stopped, remove them using the docker container rm command, followed by the containers ID list.

```
docker container rm $(docker container ls -aq)
```

## images

```bash
docker image ls
Once you’ve located the images you want to remove, pass their IMAGE ID to the docker image rm command. For example, to remove the first two images listed in the output above, you would run:
docker image rm 75835a67d134 2a4cca5ac898
```

Docker provides a docker image prune command that can be used to remove dangled and unused images.

```bash
docker image prune
docker image prune -a
```

With the docker image prune command, you can also remove images based on a particular condition with the --filter option.

```bash
docker image prune -a --filter "until=12h"
```

## volumes

To remove one or more Docker volumes, run the docker volume ls command to find the ID of the volumes you want to remove.

```bash
docker volume ls
```

Once you’ve found the VOLUME NAME of the volumes you want to remove, pass them to the docker volume rm command. For example, to remove the first volume listed in the output above, run:

```bash
docker volume rm 4e12af8913af888ba67243dec78419bf18adddc3c7a4b2345754b6db64293163
```

To remove all unused volumes, run the docker image prune command:

```bash
docker volume prune
```

To remove one or more Docker networks, use the docker network ls command to find the ID of the networks you want to remove.

```bash
docker network ls
```

Once you’ve located the networks you want to remove, pass their NETWORK ID to the docker network rm command. For example, to remove the network with the name my-bridge-network, run:

```bash
docker network rm c520032c3d31
```

Use the docker network prune command to remove all unused networks.

```bash
docker network prune
```

With the docker network prune command, you can remove networks based on condition using the --filter option.

```bash
docker network prune -a --filter "until=12h"
```

# Troubleshooting

When create your docker, after a lot of try and errors running docker build, maybe the host system has reached its limit of cache size for apt and you be introduced with a message like **apt error or apt can't connect <some url>** .I certainly sure there is a better way to solve that, but for now I'm using `docker image prune -f`.

> docker has a limit on maximum apt cache size on the host system.If you receive an apt signature error run `docker image prune -f`. **(THIS COMMAND WILL ERASE ALL DOCKER IMAGES)**
