# Why 

I decided to master some skill in this crazy year of 2020. I'm not master in anything. I consider myself as a `dumb` with effort. In the beginning of lockdown I have a discussion  with my teamate about editors and he tell me that I didn't know  10% about  `VIM`.  

So, I use linux since 1992. (yes, I'm old school), and my linux number is #244712(there is no such thing anymore).I worked for 20 years as a Systems Administrator and in 2014 I move to cybersecurity field. After some failures in use `Ubuntu` with `Virtualbox` I decided to use  `Windows` with `Vmware Workstation`. (How can you see, I'm not smart guy). Since then my daily driver machine is running Windows system.  

Why am I saying this? Because after some time thinking about what my teamate tell me, I realized he is right.  Beside my use of linux for long time I not even know 10% about `VIM` capabilities. 

# The Plan


## How I Started ?

## Comeback to Linux

In the first days of `lockdown` in my country, I decided erase `Windows` from my computer and  comeback to `Linux`  -`Ubuntu`(Some friends of my are `debian passionate` and don't like of Canonical, but I like of *Ubuntu*).

## Use VIM all DAY

For this, I not installed any other editor in my machine. In the beginning was hard. I started with basic vim movements and increase my knowledge every day.  
For this I saw video in `youtube` related with `VIM`. Since basic `VIM` until `VIM configuration files and plugins`. 



## Created My Own Vimrc

I created after saw videos from `Missing Semester` and `ThePrimeagen` in youtube. 
I copied something in the `vimrc` them and add some features that save my time. 
My `vimrc` has a lot of plugins. Tha majority of them I don't use anymore, but helped me a lot in the beginning of my journey.  

```bash
" Comments in Vimscript start with a `"`.

" If you open this file in Vim, it'll be syntax highlighted for you.

" Vim is based on Vi. Setting `nocompatible` switches from the default
" Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This
" configuration option turns out not to be necessary for the file named
" '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
" is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
" loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
" `vim -u foo`).
set nocompatible

" Turn on syntax highlighting.
syntax on

" Disable the default Vim startup message.
set shortmess+=I

" Show line numbers.
set number
"
" This enables relative line numbering mode. With both number and
" relativenumber enabled, the current line shows the true line number, while
" all other lines (above and below) are numbered relative to the current line.
" jump up or down to a particular line, by {count}k to go up or {count}j to go
" down.
set relativenumber

" Always show the status line at the bottom, even if you only have one window open.
set laststatus=2

" The backspace key has slightly unintuitive behavior by default. For example,
" by default, you can't backspace before the insertion point set with 'i'.
" This configuration makes backspace behave more reasonably, in that you can
" backspace over anything.
set backspace=indent,eol,start

" By default, Vim doesn't let you hide a buffer (i.e. have a buffer that isn't
" shown in any window) that has unsaved changes. This is to prevent you from "
" forgetting about unsaved changes and then quitting e.g. via `:qa!`. We find
" hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
" for more information on this.
set hidden

" This setting makes search case-insensitive when all characters in the string
" being searched are lowercase. However, the search becomes case-sensitive if
" it contains any capital letters. This makes searching more convenient.
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" Enable searching as you type, rather than waiting till you press enter.
"" Searching

" Unbind some useless/annoying default key bindings.
nmap Q <Nop> " 'Q' in normal mode enters Ex mode. You almost never want this.

"
" Disable audible bell because it's annoying.
set noerrorbells visualbell t_vb=

" Enable mouse support. You should avoid relying on this too much, but it can
" sometimes be convenient.
set mouse+=a

" Search mappings: These will make it so that going to the next one in a
" search will center on the line it's found in.

## How is going ?

Now, in last week of 2020, I consider myself with at least 10% of knowledge about `VIM`. In the process I learned some cool tricks that I never knew about that.  

For 2021 my goal is learn more 10% about `VIM`, starting with `macros`. 

# My Vim CheatSheet



`HJKL` are basic Vim movements. `J` and `K` move the cursor one line up and down. `H` and `L` move the cursor in the directions left  and right. 

##  word/WORD Movements 



|                   word/WORDS Movements                   |      |
| :------------------------------------------------------: | :--: |
|   **Move one word  forward (cursor before next word)**   | `w`  |
|   **Move one WORD forward (cursor before next word)**    | `W`  |
| **Move one word  backward (cursor before bacward word)** | `b`  |
| **Move one WORD  backward (cursor before bacward word)** | `B`  |
|                  **Go forward to char**                  | `f`  |
|                 **Go backward to char**                  | `t`  |
|         **Move to next char when you use f key**         | `;`  |
|       **Move to previous char when you use f key**       | `,`  |



> **In dumb words, WORD is anything without space !!!**



## Line Movements 



|          Line Movements          | Key  |

|         **End of Line**          | `$`  |
| **First non blank char in line** | `_`  |
| **Last non blank char in line**  | `g_` |
|      **First Line of File**      | `gg` |
|       **End Line of File**       | `G`  |



## Screen Movements 



|               Screen Movements               |     Key     |

|            **Middle of Screen**             |    `zz`     |
|             **Bottom of screen**             |    `zb`     |
|  **Scroll one Line up without move cursor**  | `ctrl + y ` |
| **Scroll one Line down without move cursor** | `ctrl + e ` |
|            **Scroll one-page up**            | `ctrl + b`  |
|           **Scroll one-page down**           | `ctrl + f`  |

| **Search for the word in cursor in backward direction** |         `#`         |
|         **Put Search in the middle of Screen**          | `/<search word> zz` |

|         **Put Search in the bottom  of Screen**         | `/<search word> zb` |
